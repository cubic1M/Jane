# Connectors

Jane's plan is to run a person's money for them: read every account, find the best plan in each
area, fill in the steps, and carry them out through partners (paying bills, moving money between
their own accounts, cancelling, switching, getting quotes) once the person taps yes. Connectors are
those partners. Today's beta is read-only, so everything here is **off in production** and no real
connector exists yet: what's built is the shared plumbing every connector plugs into, and sandbox
adapters that simulate partners for sample data.

## The locks

A real connector acts only when all of these hold. Each is tested.

| Lock | Where | Off means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONNECTORS=1` | env | Every connector route answers 404 and the pipeline refuses everything, sandbox included |
| `REAL_CONNECTORS[id]` | `src/config/connectors.ts`, code only | That real connector is refused (`switched_off`) |
| `REAL_MONEY_MOVEMENT` | `src/config/money-movement.ts`, code only | A real connector that moves money is refused |
| `KILL_CONNECTORS`, `CONNECTORS_KILLED=id,id` | env or the ops store (`docs/incident.md`) | Stops them again in seconds |
| Who the person is | `whyUnavailable` in `src/lib/connectors/registry.ts` | Sandbox adapters are for sample data only; real connectors for real data only; trial people never reach a real one |

## Pieces

- **`src/lib/connectors/types.ts`**: the `Connector` type: id, category, capabilities (`read`,
  `prefill`, `act`), the consent scopes it needs, `sandbox`, `movesMoney`, and its methods.
- **`src/lib/connectors/registry.ts`**: the registered connectors, each checked against its own
  definition, and `whyUnavailable`, which says why one can't be used for a person now.
- **`src/lib/connectors/gate.ts`**: a connector's `act` and `cancel` work only inside a grant naming
  that connector, that action and that person, and only the pipeline hands one out. Ported from the
  controller drafts' permission gate (#1190).
